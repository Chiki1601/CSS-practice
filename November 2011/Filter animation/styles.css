/*
First, select the element you want to animate.
In this situation, a colorful image (this will also work on text).
You will now create a keyframe animation that has one stop at 100%.
Inside of this stop, add in the filter property, this will allow you to add graphical effects to an element.
Then, use the hue-rotate function to apply a hue rotation effect on the image.
This function uses angles, so specify a number in degrees. Finally, add the animation to your element.

Final notes: If you wish to get different results,
play around with the values such as adding more stops or rotating the hue with both positive and negative values.
